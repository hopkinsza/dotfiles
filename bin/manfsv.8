.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a process supervisor.
It runs the command
.Ar command ,
sleeping for 1 second and then running it again if it dies for any reason.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is given the
.Fl l
flag, it will log the stdout and stderr of
.Ar command
to the system log, via a named pipe to an also-supervised
.Xr logger 1
process.
A custom log handler process can be used instead of
.Xr logger 1
with
.Fl c ,
or the output from
.Ar command
can be ignored completely
with
.Fl n .
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar custom_logger
